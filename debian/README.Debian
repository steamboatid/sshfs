sshfs for Debian
----------------

Please note that the simplest way to allow mounting of sshfs shares is to
add the user to the fuse group (which will be created by the fuse-utils
package).

To add user 'foo' to the 'fuse' group type the following command (with root
privileges):

	adduser foo fuse

If the user is currently logged in he/she should log out and log in order
for this change to take effect.
